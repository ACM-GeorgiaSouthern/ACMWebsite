## Note For Developers

Any changes made by a non-officer must be done in a separate branch and reviewed before merging into the main branch.

Naming Convention for Branches: Just keep it short but related to what you're working on. <br>
If you're working on the about section, name your branch "About", if Sliding Images, name it "slideImgs" or something like that. Short but descriptive.

The site is up at https://acmgsu.com/ <br>
